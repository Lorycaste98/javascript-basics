This simple JavaScript counter is one of the projects for the Master in Full Stack Development for [start2impact](https://www.start2impact.it/) UNIVERSITY.

### The assignment:

Create a JavaScript application that allows the user to increase or decrease the counter value. Upon entering the page, the user should encounter a counter value set to 0, along with two buttons labeled "+" and "-" to modify the value.


## Application Development

### The idea

The idea I started with was to recreate the counter with a design resembling that of a sports stopwatch. I looked for an image that suited my purpose and then inserted it into the HTML file. Afterward, I modified it by incorporating the four essential elements of the application: the screen displaying the counter value, and the buttons '+', '-', and 'reset'.

In the script.js file, there are a few simple functions that enable the functionality of the application. Additionally, I have included a condition that allows the use of keyboard buttons to perform certain actions.
